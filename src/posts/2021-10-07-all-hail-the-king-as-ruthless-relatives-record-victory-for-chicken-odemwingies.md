The cold grasp of winter did nothing to subdue the fiery rivalry shared between the Brown Army and Chicken-Odemwingies on Tuesday evening.





The Estadio de Mirwin witnessed what can happen when relatives come together to great effect. No, not a Cornish threesome, just a strike force made up of combative, clinical and composed cousins. Making their debut was Rosie King, whose natural and biological connection with Bend it like (Imogen) Belton was the difference between the two sides. 



But much like in a threesome, there is always someone feeding off of scraps. That in this instance happened to be the lesser of the Kirwin twins, Max, who had a night to forget for the Brown Army. Not to be outdone, his counterpart Nick Trott was the latest victim of a trademark Lamprill nutmeg. 



While Kirwin and Through the Legs Trott were busy hanging their sizeable heads in shame, King was busy punishing the opposition goalkeeper with more conviction than Within Temptation’s resident dominatrix. Linking up with Belton, Farrelly and Ivan the Great, King dispatched her finishes and secured a memorable hatrick on her first outing.

Football and threesomes do surprisingly share some occupational hazards, including but certainly not excluding the odd ball to the face. Just ask Alys. Like a magnet for injuries, Miller once again left the field more beaten and bruised than an old apple you left in your bag and forgot about. Vicky Walmesley, the perpetrator in chief, was uncharacteristically off her game as the ball fell to her feet inside the area only to see her effort fire straight into the chops of Miller. 



After a brief break in play, familiar service resumed, with Belton and King causing the opposition all kinds of problems. Late in the game after a poor tackle, Chicken-Odemwingies were awarded a rare freekick. There was only one player who could step up to the plate. Miller, determined to save what little face she had left, stepped forth and fired a fearsome finish into the bottom left corner sending the crowd into pure jubilant celebration. 



Having just seen his better half score a screamer, Lloyd, sporting a rather dashing Honey-badger-like hairdo, pulled out something extraordinary. No, he did not pull that out hoping to turn this threesome into a foursome. Instead, from way inside his own half, he fires the ball clean over everyone’s heads (take note Vicky you savage) and into the back of the Brown Army net. Goal of the season contender? I guess you will have to wait for the soon to be announced awards show to find out...



Max, a man in his latter years, must be trying to relive something of the 90s rave scene with his new favourite toy, a piercing whistle making a very unwelcome appearance. And, as many hope to happen in a threesome, something had to get blown. The full whistle brought an end to an ever exhilarating encounter, with everyone already looking forward to the next fixture.
