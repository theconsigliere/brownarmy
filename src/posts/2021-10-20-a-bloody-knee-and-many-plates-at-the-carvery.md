Charlie Chaplin once said, “I always like walking in the rain, so no one can see me cry” and you can be sure that a few players last night were glad of the downpour to mask their tears, with a number succumbing to the notorious nutmeg. While the likes of Ivan ‘Running out of Superlatives to describe him’ The Majestic and others felt the cool breeze of the ball pass through their legs, it was Cameron Hodder who opened the floodgates, lets say. The culprit? Infectious Imogen Belton, who, having spent a number of weeks on the sidelines, took to the pitch like a duck to water. Deep inside the Brown Army half, Imogen took control of the ball well before turning and swiftly shifting the ball clean through the cavernous gap between Hodder’s legs. 

No player was keeping something for another rainy day, each left everything out on the pitch, in one players’ case you can take that literally. An official search is currently underway at the stadium, with authorities and volunteers looking for a chunk of Ivan’s knee which was sacrificed for one of his iconic ‘slide tackles’ (coordinated falls). While they’re searching they might as well have a look for Rory’s touch as well, with the ball bouncing off his feet like a trampoline. Though of course we could put that down to the many plates of carvery consumed at Toby Carvery pre-match, famously a staple in the diets of elite athletes.  

Adele might have Set Fire to the Rain, but on a wet pitch ‘Heavy’ Ben Stanbury set fire to the pitch with some sparkling footwork. Linking up well with Charles ‘Guiness Guzzler’ Farrelly and the Cornish Cousins, Stanbury made a few of the Brown Army players look like a Fool in the Rain. It was a very welcome return to form for Chicken Odemwingies’ forward Rosie King, whose combinations with Imogen Patient Zero Belton saw King fire home some delightful goals. 

However, even if Hodder had thought he had recovered from his first case of nutmegitous given to him from Patient Zero, he was about to wish there was a vaccine to protect you from nutmegs. Standing in goal, Hodder took up a good position to face up against Nick Non Stop not Instant Noodles Trott, who drove a shot in low towards him. Seemingly in control of the situation, Hodder braced himself, only for Belton to instinctively stick a toe out and force the ball through his legs once again. At this point Hodder was hardly Singing in the Rain, instead hanging his head in shame with images of Travis in his head singing and asking Why Does it Always Rain on Me? 

He would, however, have the last laugh. With the game drawing to a close, the fixture would be settled with another Golden Goal. Not for the first time, the ball reached Hodder just outside of the Chicken Odemwingies box. Taking it in his stride he took a touch, composed himself, and fired a well placed effort into the far corner sealing the victory for the Brown Army. 

Player of the Match: Max Kirwin

Many players shone through the rain clouds, but none as brightly as Max Kirwin, more commonly known as Harri’s brother. Kirwin’s energy and composed style of play gave Brown Army a solid foundation to build from. I rate his performance 4 out of 5 Noodles.
