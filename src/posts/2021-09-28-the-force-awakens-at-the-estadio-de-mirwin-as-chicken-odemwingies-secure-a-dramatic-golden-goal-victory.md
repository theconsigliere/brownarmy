There are few finer sights in football than seeing the old pigskin fly off a boot and into the top corner. Fans could therefore be considered spoilt after a feast of ferocious finishing took centre stage in Tuesday night’s Dirty Martini Derby. 



Fielding a much changed line-up, Chicken-Odemwingies began the game slowly as the new teammates took their time to gel. This was not made easier when being faced with the consistently clinical Alys Miller. Product of Vinnie Jones’ infamous Throat Puncher Academy, Miller’s no-nonsense style to the game proved effective early on in the game as she continued her fine form in front of goal. However, it would soon come back to bite her. 



At the other end there was a double-debut, with “Queen” Vicky Walmesley and Lauren “Fleet-of-Foot” Flitcroft lining up together in attack for Chicken-Odemwingies. Supported by the constant running of Charles Farrelly and the Chode in the Box, the two debutants helped their side regain some control of the game with intricate football in the final third. 



Energy levels began to rise as both sides sought out control of the game. With both sides exchanging the lead, up stepped Walmesley to thump in two thunderbolts, strikes which even the GOAT Cristiano Ronaldo would be proud of. Not to be outdone, Flitcroft also got in on the action, with predatory instincts inside the box to make it a debut to remember. 



It is not uncommon to hear the term “wrestling” used in football, whether it be about taking the initiative, or a combative style of play. But Tuesday night took things to a whole new level. Alys “Stone Cold” Miller did however take the brunt of it, in a game which saw more hits than a Now That's What I Call Music album. Despite rolling both ankles, being mowed down by Rory, getting hit by the ball 38 times, and receiving a beatdown from Hodder, Miller soldiered on for her team valiantly. 



The game continued on in a typically frantic fashion. Both teams were exchanging blows, even if Miller was the only one on the receiving end, as the game rolled on into the final quarter of an hour. With both Flitcroft and Walmesley being substituted to a rapturous ovation from their adoring new fans in the stands, their side were lacking some fire power upfront. Chicken-Odemwingies needed a hero...

But there was to A New Hope for the team, as the ball fell to the feet of Choda who, using a combination of the force and blossoming footballing talent, fired his shot into the top right corner. It was a moment which would live long in the memory of Choda, who is best known for his Chode in the hole style finishing. The golden goal sealed an impressive victory for Chicken-Odemwingies, who must be considering a permanent deal for Choda after yet another stand out performance from the player. 



Attention has already turned to next week’s fixture, with many fans and pundits asking the same questions. Can “Fleet of Foot” Flitcroft and Queen Walmesley build on their dream debuts? Can anyone afford Alys Miller’s medical bills? Will Nick ever be bothered to do some proper photoshopping? Stay tuned. Stay frosty. Stay fruity.
