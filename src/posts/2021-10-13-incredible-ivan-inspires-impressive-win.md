The only thing to brighten up these longer nights is another instalment of the fierce and frantic derby between the Brown Army and Chicken Odemwingies, with the two sides writing another compelling and colourful chapter in their history on Tuesday evening.





The match started with typical vigour and energy, with both sides grappling for control. As the game opened up, both sides began to get more expansive and forward thinking. But there was nothing *Clucky* about Chicken-Odemwingies’ play in the final third, with Charming Charlie linking up the play with Slow Ben and Ruthless Rosie. Smart and slick football from the away side caused a lot of trouble for the Brown Army, but with level heads, defenders Rory Carr and Jack Crathern managed to keep the score at 0-0.  



Warming weary winter souls was Ivan. The world’s first breakdancing footballer, Ivan put his heart, body, and soul on the line for a typically chaotic and courageous performance. Winning every header, covering every blade of short sharp artificial grass, and even dishing out a crunching slide tackle that the honey badger Lloyd Bond would be proud of. With Harri receiving possession in goal, insatiable Ivan hunted down the ball like with more hunger in his eyes than Imogen’s ex and one of his cousins on the pull in Cornwall, and made a bone shattering tackle which resulted in the ball finding its way into the back of the net. 



There was not much that the Chicken Odemwingie's players could do about a performance like Ivan’s, aside from ensuring they did not suffer the same fate as Harri. But someone had to try something. It is not easy for any journalist or publication to admit when they are wrong, but it remains vitally important that they do. In the case of BAS (Brown Army Sport), we must apologise to Slow Ben, damn it, sorry it is a habit - Reasonably Pacy Ben Stanbury - for spending much of the season belittling his agility, acceleration, and speed. In last night’s game Reasonable Pace Ben burnt passed Rory ‘runs as fast as a broken down’ Carr on a couple occasions to provide a potent attacking threat. 



Following on from a dream debut, Rosie King buzzed around the Brown Army defence like a busy fly – quite apt for a team named after literal human excrement. Without her strike partner, Belton, King was looking for service from elsewhere. Bambi on Ice Ben, Rosie’s partner, provided good strong runs down either flank, when he wasn’t falling flat on his arse under the supposedly slippery conditions. Admittedly, if you did watch a highlight reel of just Bambi on Ice Ben and Ivan the Great’s games, you would be forgiven for thinking that the game was in fact played on an ice rink. 



Both teams took control of proceedings at different stages of the match, with Choda and Harri’s twin brother both registering goals for the Brown Army. At the other end, Cameron ‘The Cat’ Hodder produced perhaps the save of the season with an incredible reaction save to keep his side in the lead. That stop would soon prove to be invaluable, with the Brown Army eventually taking home the spoils after a last minute goal from some very short sighted guy whose name I forget. Snoggy Moggy Belton was unavailable yet again this week, with her clinical presence in attack a real miss. Likewise Georgie Lamprill, who kindly took a week off (albeit forced) from embarrassing everyone with her skill and nutmegs. Both look set to be available for next week’s fixture, with many anticipating the fireworks sure to come from the new rivalry between Harri and Ivan, as well as the possibility of a new top speed for Reasonably Pacy Ben.
