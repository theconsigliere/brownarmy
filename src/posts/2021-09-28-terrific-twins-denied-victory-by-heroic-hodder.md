Chicken-Odemwingies, however, were devoid of inspiration, of impotence. Up step Torbay’s Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum. Max and Harri Kirwin occupied the opposition’s box together much like they did their mother’s womb for large portions of the game. This natural connection was vital in seeing Wingies clawing back at the Skid Mark’s lead.  

Despite their valiant efforts, supported by the ever deadly Georgie and Jack, one man and one man alone held his side back. Nick “Noodle Arms” Trott may point towards his hat-trick of nutmegs against Rory, or his brace of nutmegs against Cameron ‘Gaping hole between the legs’ Hodder, as get out of jail free cards, but nothing can make up for his exploits in defense or in between the sticks. 



Late in the game Stanbury attempted an audacious lob over the short-sighted stopper. The ball, falling gently and comfortably into Trott’s bread basket, somehow spinned off one of his baby-sized hands and into the back of the net. Such a mistake may be forgiven, but not when this was his second ‘own goal’ of the game. Moments earlier, a well-judged tackle by Trott evaded the grasp of his keeper, Kirwin, and nestled into the bottom corner. 



Despite those shambles, the headlines undeniably belong to Hodder, who, for a second week, sealed the game for his side with a golden-goal strike. This clinical finishing at such a crucial moment has not only led to more people appreciating his cool calm composure, but has also raised eyebrows of scientists across the world. According to reports, the veteran striker has since undergone experiments to see why he is just so collected at the close of play. Scientists were shocked to see a powerful and unique mixture of ice, Eat the Bird, and coffee running through his veins. 



Next week is set up to be a bumper fixture, with the return of Belton, Miller, and possibly Temple who have all been sidelined.
