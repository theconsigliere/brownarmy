The two teams served up a treat for their adoring supporters yet again, as much rotated squads battled it out for the victory. 

Dressed ready for the final of Wimbledon, Ivan, his head band and accompanying polo shirt took no time to frantically disrupt any semblance of an attack from Chicken Odemwingies. Advantage went to the Brown Army early in the game, with new on-loan signings Zoe and Tilly controlling the play in the final third. If not for some Ace goalkeeping, the game could have been taken away from The Wingies, but fine saves seemed to invigorate the team. 

While the saves certainly inspired the Wingies, it was the Return of the King which really drove them forward. Rosie took to the game like a duck to water, buzzing around the opposition's box causing a constant headache for the Brown Army. The role of supplying the King with goal scoring opportunities fell to debutant Will Martin, who looks like a surefire fan favourite with his llama-like hair and graceful presence on the pitch. 

As both sides exchanged chances, each player was keen to get themselves on the score sheet. Rory Carr adventured forward late in the first half to get in on the action. After some nice build up play, his chance came. Seeing his name up in lights, already dreaming about the newspaper headlines and glowing match report, Carr bounded up to the ball and unleashed a gastly ballooning shot sailing clean over the head of every Wingies defender and up into the atmosphere. After a few moments, the ball returned back down to Earth, slightly frozen, and fell into the netting high up on the fence.



Fortunately, his teammates seemed to fare much better. The goal of the game, and perhaps a contender for goal of the season came from Tilly. After some frantic attacking football from the Brown Army, Tilly took a fine touch and instinctively lobbed the ball over the head of Andrew in the Wingies' goal. A simply sublime finish, though critics will perhaps point to the fact that it is not hard to lob a keeper who thanks to his height, can still get into the cinema with a childs’ ticket. 



As the game drew to a close Ivan, who might decide to set up a side hustle as a Bjorn Borg impersonator, wowed the capacity crowd with one of his famous groin-tearing splits in the final moments. No international break will stop the action at the Estadio de Mirwin, with the action resuming again next Tuesday, where many players are expected to return. 



Player of the Match: 



Anna, Tilly, Zoe. 



Three new signings shone on Tuesday evening. With boundless energy, brilliant ball control, and fantastic finishing, Anna, Tilly and Zoe are three very welcome additions to the squads of both the Brown Army and Chicken Odemwingies.
