Tuesday night’s encounter between the Brown Army and Chicken Odemwingies shared the same date as American writer Mark Twain, who once said “Give every day the chance to become the most beautiful of your life.” That’s all well and good, but try saying that after being nutmegged...

With many in the festive spirit, you may fancy yourself a hot chocolate dusted with some nutmeg. That’s if there isn’t a shortage, after another festival of football at the Estadio de Mirwin on Tuesday night served up numerous nutmegs, fierce finishing, and knockout kits. 

Despite the tepid temperatures, everyone was quick to get up to speed with the game. Andrew was a constant nuisance for the Chicken Odemwingies. Buzzing around the pitch, his constant carries and link-up play helped squeeze the Brown Army further up the field. It was a strong performance from the player, but he will be replaying a few moments over in his mind. Andrew Meggs was on the wrong end of a series of nutmegs, yes, you literally cannot write it, Meggs was getting ‘megged. But to his testament, Meggy McMeggason picked up his head and continued to bombard the opposition defence with mazy runs and a near-constant press. 

He was not the only one to feel the cool breeze of a nutmeg whizz between their legs. Rory Carr, who oversaw a very commanding control of the Brown Army’s defence, may want to consider focussing less time on arm day and more on legs after an on-fire Charles Farrelly placed the ball calmly through Carr’s legs. Maybe some bigger calves could have saved him from such an embarrassment. But that should not take anything away from what was a lovely goal from Farrelly, who found fine goalscoring form on Tuesday night. Farrelly’s goal was another coming from a composed Chicken Odemwingie’s counter, with the returning Ben Stanbury regularly linking up with Imogen, Anna, and Rosie. 

Neither side lacked any bite in the attacking third, but one player may have taken that a little too far. Bravely charging down Stanbury, Emma Sullivan slipped on the slick surface and appeared to chomp down on the astro with more intent than Imogen tucking into a bagel. Fortunately Sullivan was able to pick herself up with no lasting damage, except perhaps some slight bruising to her chin and ego. 

Sporting the hottest kit of the season, Max Kirwin was desperate to mark the occasion with a goal. Ever willing and hungry, Kirwin did not hide from wanting to receive the ball. However, the Torbay Tormentor had to wait until late in the game for his opportunity. Jack Crathern broke through the line and slotted a delightful cut back right to the feet of Kirwin, who with one touch exposed the keeper and with another, fired the ball into the near post. The goalkeeper in question was Nick ‘Judas Iscariot’ Trott, who announced his departure from Dirty Martini earlier in the day, though reports suggest that Nick ‘The Snake’ Trott will continue to represent the Chicken Odemwingies, per contract negotiations with Kirwin. Earlier in the game Nick ‘Scar from the Lion King’ Trott had been embarrassed by a venomous volley from distance, which flew off the foot of Crathern. 

The game on Tuesday followed a big day for the Brown Army. First came the arrival of the much anticipated kit for the 2021/2022 season. At the club’s scheduled press event to cover the launch, Director of Football and the Brown Army’s finest bib distributor Max Kirwin could hardly contain his excitement, “I will never take the new kit off. I will wear it to bed, when I am not flushing the toilet, to games, even my dominatrix at Temptations will have a hard time getting this off of me.” Authorities have now opened several investigations on Kirwin, with charges likely. 

The Estadio de Mirwin also welcomed back Ben Stanbury. Club physios were alerted to a possible knee injury suffered by Stanbury several weeks ago, with some suggesting it may have been sustained during Stanbury’s extra-curricular activities like getting swole, womanising, and posing aesthetically pleasing Insta stories. Clearly the physios had worked wonders, because Ben was back to his best. Dictating the play, he frequently tried to put the Brown Army defence to the sword. There was no sympathy from off-field friend Carr, however, who certainly tested the medical department’s handy work with some robust challenges. 

In between the goals a personal battle was boiling. The A-Team, better known as Anna and Andrew, seemed to continuously come face-to-face during the game. But more often than not,  Anna Beat a Bewildered Andrew - ABBA. Andrew, seeking redemption, kept pleading with his teammates to Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! The ball, saying that they needed to Take a Chance on Me. But ultimately, the Winner Takes it All, and on this occasion that was Anna, who was not short of putting in a challenge, nor using her skill to make space for herself and her team. Anna was rewarded for her emphatic efforts by that bastard snake Nick Trott, who rashly, unforgivably fired the ball into her thigh. What a prick. 

We are all eagerly anticipating next week's encounter already. With the possible return of Miller, further battles from the A-Team, and progress photos from Rory's calf workouts, See You Next Tuesday. 

Player of the Match: 

Andrew Megg & Jack Crathern 

One brought more energy than a can of Red Bull laced with cocaine, the other a cool calming feeling that would make Aloe Vera jealous. It would be easier to split a coconut with a wet leaf of lettuce, so both players will have to share the Player of the Match award this week.
