Ecsquisit, beautiful, technically excellent, and flawless. These are just a few of the words which will not be used to describe the latest installment of the Dirty Martini Derby at the Estadio de Mirwin on Wednesday night. 



Depleted numbers and a last-minute change to the date did not stop the festival of football happening again this week, as Chicken Odemwingies went in search of redemption over fierce rivals the Brown Army. 



The game began in frantic fashion, with dominant twin Harri turning up late, much to the frustration of his much slower but much better-sighted brother Max. Despite this setback, both teams began the game with a traditionally tortoise-like pace to proceedings. 



Star midfielder Ben “Looks like he’s standing still when he’s running” Stanbury took the game by the scruff of the neck, dictating the play for the Brown Army early on. Supported by willing runners Cameron Hodder and Emma, the Brown Army quickly took the lead. In no time, the home side had slotted four goals past a helpless Chicken Odemwingies defense. Step forth Alys Miller. 



Having spent a week on the sidelines with COVID, Miller wasted no time in returning to her infamous goal-scoring escapades, almost single-handedly eating away at the Brown Army’s lead with fine finishing. 

At the other end, Hodder, who was recently snubbed for an England call up by Gareth the Snake Southgate, proved why he is one of the sharpest scorers in the business. Regularly finding himself in dangerous positions, Hodder quickly found his goalscoring touch and continued to punish the opposition's complete lack of defensive due diligence. Such fine finishing has not gone unnoticed amongst the fan base, who have quickly reworked the famous term Fox in the Box, a description for forwards who are deadly in the box, to Chode in the Hole. A combination of Hodder’s name, and the classic English staple, Toad in the Hole. 



But while the Chode in the Hole showed his ever improving talent on the football pitch, his evening will be best remembered for his best Chuckle Brothers impersonation with Emma. Clear through on goal the pair almost reenacted the famous scenes from the much beloved actors and DJs #ToMe,ToYouBruv. Both forwards seemed more willing to satisfy the other - read into that what you will. As Hodder and Emma exchanged passes across the six yard line, before finally scoring the goal. Was it simply politeness? Or was this a well orchestrated training ground maneuver to deceive the opposition? Either way, the goal all but cemented the Brown Army’s dominance in the game. 



Next week proves to be another exciting encounter, with the introduction of known football hooligan Vicky. While speculation is rife across social media as to whether the transfer of Lauren is to be believed. You will just have to stay tuned for more pure nonsense.
