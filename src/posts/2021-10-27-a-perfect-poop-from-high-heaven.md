The game started slow as both teams worked on getting into the groove after excessive alcohol poisoning, but brown army began pulling away with an important linking of passes. Andrew ‘Megs’ took a few fancy touches and saw off Mirwin easily early in the game.

Not to be deterred the odemwingies fought back and Ivan ‘the terrible’ or Ivan ‘the Ritalin’ drove the ball up the pitch for link up of this own, this lead to a flurry of goals and nutmegs with Chaz ‘the Guiness ‘ and Keeleigh ‘kilo’ featuring heavily. Imogen ‘bell sniff, beaner, Cornish Karen’ etc looked good throughout smashing in two wonderful strikes.

For early moments of the game it was difficult to see who would edge it. Adam ‘The Wall’ was not to be stopped however and was ever present penetrating the box with his never ending height.

It was easy to see why ‘the wall’ was sent down from Scotland to enforce a separation between Scotland and england just like he seperated the chicken odemwingies from the brown army goal. But not everything went to plan with ‘the Guiness’ easily destroying the opposition with speed, agility and a few dirty pints before placing the ball sweetly between the posts and between megs's open and wanting legs.

But dispite all of this, Brown Army shone throughout, the moment of the match happended just ten minutes before time when One of the Georgie circle nodded a beautiful ball sweetly into the back of the net. The Odemwingies went through a period of utter turmoil, only compounded by Imo-minge's unwillingness to ‘put her body on the line’ as she openly refused to play in goal.

The game was more than lost when ‘Ritalin boy’ pushed up to unleash hell but unwittingly gave the ball away allowing the brown army to stick a ball of brown straight into the open goal.
