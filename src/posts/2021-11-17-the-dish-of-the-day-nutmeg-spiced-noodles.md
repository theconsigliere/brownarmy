The musical The Sound of Music opened on Broadway, the end of the Ottoman Empire, the founding of UNESCO, ABBA’s first tour of Europe. November 16th is synonymous with majorly significant historical events, and that list grew on Tuesday night, after a nightmarish nutmeg and heroic hat trick. 



Fans for years to come will look back on Tuesday 16th November at the Estadio de Mirwin and say, “I was there”, when recalling the latest bout between the Brown Army and Chicken Odemwingies. The two tactically terrific teams trying to taste triumph shared moments of glory in a typically enthralling encounter. 



Early into the game the Brown Army were dragged up field by their fearless - or perhaps insane - leader Ivan. Sharing beautifully worked exchanges with Tilly and Zoe in the final third, Ivan and co tore apart a toothless Chicken Odemwingie's defence. With the support of two of last weeks’ players of the match, Ivan was being fed a seemingly never ending supply of passes and through balls. The part time Bjorn Borg lookalike of course took much of the plaudits for his goalscoring escapades, but credit really lies with Tilly, Zoe, and the return of a majestically poised Georgie.

There was little to excite the fans of Chicken Odemwingies, until Charles Farrelly had the sheer audacity to pull off (your dad) a long range nutmeg on the now overconfident Ivan. With hawk-like vision, Farrelly cooly slotted a tantalizing through ball between the legs of the opposing player. This moment seemed to invigorate his team mates. 



Another of last week’s players of the match, Anna, took up a commanding role in the centre of midfield for the Chicken Odemwingies on Tuesday night. Receiving the ball in tight areas, Anna would turn and distribute the ball like a prime Michael Carrick. This composure would soon come to haunt the Brown Army. But not before they set upon yet another offensive. 



Lloyd Bond instigated the attack with a trademark cross field pass, before Georgie was slotted through on goal. With only Andrew to beat, Georgie was licking her lips at the prospect of comfortably opening her account for the evening. Andrew had other ideas. As Georgie got closer, Andrew’s eyes darkened, thunder crackled overhead, dogs began to howl, and something unholy came over the stand-in goalkeeper. Clattering into Georgie with full force, Andrew could do nothing to prevent the goal, but the maniac was determined to leave his mark on the opposing player in the hopes that she would not try that again. 



Elsewhere, it was something of a November nightmare for Nick Trott – better known as Noodle – who not only continued to see his side fall behind to the Brown Army, but would be served further embarrassment at the hands of Alys Miller. Frantically trying not to upset a clearly explosive Andrew, Noodle was floundering around in defense hoping to prevent his team falling further behind as well as anyone suffering GBH at the hands of Andrew. The ever opportunistic Alys Miller saw this as her chance. Calmly controlling the ball, Miller turned and as she was approached by Noodle, devastatingly dispatched the ball clean through the wide gap left between his legs. Someone needed the spare Noodle’s blushes, as well as calm and distract Andrew. Up stepped Imogen “Bea-nd it like Beckham” Belton. 



Having been in and out of Chicken Odemwingie's line up for various reasons, Belton has been finding her feet again on the football field. But Tuesday night’s performance put any nerves or doubts to bed. Linking up with the awesome Anna and razor-sharp Rosie, impeccable Imogen fired home three well-placed finishes beyond despairing keepers to keep her side in the fight. 



One player certainly showing no lack of fight was Rosie. You could tell it was National Button Day, as Rosie was trying her best to push Lloyd’s buttons. Never giving Bond a moment’s peace, King hounded down her opponent constantly. In no time, King was living rent free in Bond’s head, with the experienced and exuberant Torquay native succumbing to his diminutive counterpart. Thanks to the energy and sheer tenacity on show from King, her teammates could profit; none more so than her cousin and star striker Belton. 



The Brown Army walked away with the spoils in the end, thanks to an uncharacteristically stable and surefooted performance from Ivan and midfield maestros Zoe, Tilly, and Georgie. 



Player of the Match - Imogen Belton 



One player who has had more than her fair share of grief from these match reports; Imogen, Mogs, Moggy, Snoggy Moggy, turns up each week with infectious enthusiasm and was rewarded on Tuesday with a well-deserved hat trick. A special mention should go to Anna who impressed yet again, as well as an assured performance from Alys.
