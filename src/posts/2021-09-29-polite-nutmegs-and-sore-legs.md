Some of the more ‘senior’ players will be feeling their sore legs today, with a select few experiencing a kind of phantom limb sensation which can only come from the embarrassment of a nutmeg. 



One player will understand this feeling better than most. Having seen more action between his legs than a lady of the night in a port town last week - six nutmegs - Cameron Hodder once again fell victim, this time to perhaps the politeness nutmeg ever dished out on the football field. 



‘Mad-Dog’ Maddie Coleman received the ball on the right wing with typical poise and grace before being faced with Hodder who was covering the flank. With magnetic-like ball control Mad-Dog approached her opposing number before exclaiming “Excuse me”, causing Hodder to spread his legs like warm butter only to see the ball be passed through the void and on to Belton, who was on fine goal-scoring form. 

Belton, who has plied her trade in the more agricultural Cornish leagues, took Tuesday night by storm. No goalkeeper was safe when the ball fell at her feet. Firstly Hodder, who despite showing a markedly improved performance, could not reach down to prevent a well placed finish from ending up in the back of the net. Next to fall victim to Belton’s brilliance was veteran Max Kirwin. Another fiery finish was destined for the bottom corner, and despite Kirwin’s best efforts which resulted in at least one pulled groin, Belton couldn’t be stopped. It was yet another muscular injury suffered on Tuesday evening, with one fan describing the action vividly, “I haven’t seen so many things getting pulled since I was last on a night out with Imogen.”



It was a typically end-to-end and frantic festival of football, a style of play synonymous with a Tuesday night at the Estadio de Mirwin. 



New faces including Emma did not let the occasion get the better of them, however. Putting in a player of the match performance, the winger demonstrated her desire and drive to win back the ball for her team on many occasions. 



Attention once again turns to next Tuesday, where key players including Alys ‘Punch your Throat’ Miller look set to return having been sidelined through Covid related issues. Will Cameron finally understand who is on his team? Is anyone going to walk away from an encounter with Charles without a bruised shin? Can Belton continue to score goals as frequently as she scores on nights out? You will just have to stay tuned for next weeks’ Dirty Martini Match Report.
